# Navigation 3 - Code recipes
[Jetpack Navigation 3](https://goo.gle/nav3) is a library for app navigation. This repository contains recipes for how to 
use its APIs to implement common navigation use cases. Each recipe introduces a single concept. Instead
of making existing recipes more complex, there should be a new recipe for that particular concept.

Every Navigation 3 release will be an opportunity for patterns you see in recipes to "graduate" and become
(optional) helpers in the library itself. Then we'll update the recipe to use that prebuilt helper, thus
ensuring that the recipes continue to be a good way to approach these kinds of problems.

## Recipes
These are the recipes and what they demonstrate. 

### Basic API examples
- **[Basic](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basic)**: Shows most basic API usage.
- **[Saveable back stack](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basicsaveable)**: As above, with a persistent back stack.
- **[Entry provider DSL](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basicdsl)**: As above, using the entryProvider DSL.

### Layouts using Scenes
- **[List-Detail Scene](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/listdetail)**: Shows how to create a custom, list-detail layout using a `Scene` and `SceneStrategy` (see video of UI behavior below).
- **[Two pane Scene](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/twopane)**: Shows how to create a custom, 2-pane layout.
- **[BottomSheet](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/bottomsheet)**: Shows how to create a BottomSheet destination.
- **[Dialog](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/dialog)**: Shows how to create a Dialog.

### Material adaptive layouts
Examples showing how to use the layouts provided by the [Compose Material3 Adaptive Navigation3 library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3-adaptive#compose_material3_adaptive_navigation3_version_10_2)
- **[List-Detail](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/material/listdetail)**: Shows how to use a Material adaptive list-detail layout.
- **[Supporting Pane](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/material/supportingpane)**: Shows how to use a Material adaptive supporting pane layout.

### Animations
- **[Animations](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/animations)**: Shows how to override the default animations for all destinations and a single destination.

### Common use cases
- **[Common navigation UI](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/commonui)**: A common navigation toolbar where each item in the toolbar navigates to a top level destination.
- **[Conditional navigation](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/conditional)**: Switch to a different navigation flow when a condition is met. For example, for authentication or first-time user onboarding.

### Architecture
- **[Modularized navigation code](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/modular/hilt)**: Demonstrates how to decouple navigation code into separate modules (uses Dagger/Hilt for DI). 

### Passing navigation arguments to ViewModels
- **[Basic ViewModel](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/passingarguments/viewmodels/basic)**: Navigation arguments are passed to a ViewModel constructed using `viewModel()`
- **[Hilt injected ViewModel](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/passingarguments/viewmodels/hilt)**: Navigation arguments are passed to a ViewModel constructed using `hiltViewModel()`
- **[Koin injected ViewModel](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/passingarguments/viewmodels/koin)**: Navigation arguments are passed to a ViewModel constructed using `koinViewModel()`

### Returning Results
- **[Returning Results as Events](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/results/event)**: Returning results as events to content in another NavEntry.
- **[Returning Results as State](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/results/state)**: Returning results as state stored in a CompositionLocal.

### Planned
- **Deeplinks**: Create and handle deeplinks to specific destinations
- **Android XR**: Custom navigation and layout behavior for Android XR

## Custom layout example
The following is a screen recording showing the navigation behavior of a [custom, list-detail Scene](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/listdetail).
